# [Project : Investigating Patients not showing for check-ups ](https://github.com/MMallah/Why-Patients-miss-appointments/blob/master/Why%20Patients%20don't%20show%20Up..ipynb)

The data set in hand, has information about the attendance of patients after making an appointment for a check up, it has 110.527 medical appointments it's 14 associated variables. We will be analysing trends for patients who showed up Vs. Patients who didn't show for the appointment, and how they differ.

* Here we have our first finding, for Age having a sort of relation ship on showing up or not, from the right graph we notice, that the IQR and the median are shifted to the left Vs. the left figure, which gives some indication that younger people might have higher chance to miss an appointment, and we notice for ages starting 39 years old and above people are more likely to adhere to their appointment.
* It is noticable that percentage of patients not showing up having received multiple SMS, shows a much stronger association compared for patients attending, and it is one the Variables having largest association with Not showing to the appointment.
* We find an interesting insight, that people with scholarships might have a relationship, with not showing, as the number of patients having a scholarship and missed the appointment increased a little bit compared to patients with no Scholarships,after refering back to the wikipedia page for the scholarship.
* Now after knowing that Scholarship variable, is an indication of funding based on School attendance, it clears the logic, behind healthy people reserving an appointment in a clinic, perhaps for Vacination or to check on the students attendance at school, and having about 80% of Healthy people making up the bulk of the attendies missing the appointment, it is more likely for healthy individual to miss an appointment in comparison to a patient going for a treatment.
* Waiting time seems to have some relationship with missing an appointment, as people are more associated to attend if the time between the reservation date and actual appointment is only one day, while the No-show is observed to have higher percentages of not showing up if the period is larger than 7 days.



# [Project 2:Comparing Cosmetics Products By Ingredients](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MMallah/Comparing-Cosmetics-Ingredients/blob/bf4d84812d880be9d5845b0ec1c9c91d6d9a2d0d/Comparing%20Cosmetics%20Products%20By%20Ingredients.ipynb)
Content-based recommendation system based on ingredients

* Create a content-based recommendation system based on ingredients.
* Focused on one sample of products.
* Use Tokenization and Dcoment-term-Matrix (DTM) per product.
* Utilizse T-SNE for dimensionality reduction to make it easier to compare products.
* Visualize the composition similiarty between products.
* Now it is easier to find similar products and compare prices.
